## 📦 Basic Python Syntax

```python
# Print to the console
print("Hello, Python!")
```

```python
# Variables
name = "Ayesha"
age = 25

```

```python
# Conditional Statements
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

```python
# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration", i)
```
